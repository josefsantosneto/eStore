# EStore Project

This product was made following the instructions of the course Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL).

## Details of the path through this

By the time it was made, the progress of it was in 54%. So far, I could apply lots of concepts in React, some of which I consider really important are:
- React Router
- Authentication using firebase
- React Context for State Management
- Firebase Database Storage
- Styled components
- Reducers
- Redux
